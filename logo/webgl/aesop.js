aesopText = "   The Mice in Council\n \n     Once upon a time all the mice met together in council, and \n     discussed the best means of securing themselves against the\n     attacks of the cat. \n\n     After several suggestions had been \n     debated, a mouse of some standing and experience got up\n     and said,\n        \"I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure\n     our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it\n     out. It is that we should fasten a bell around the neck of our\n     enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her\n     approach.\" \n\n     This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been\n     already decided to adopt it, when an old mouse got upon his\n     feet and said, \n        \"I agree with you all that the plan before us\n     is an admirable one: but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?\""
